## Schrimp Virus Detection Project 🦐
* This project represents the 1st Phase of an end-to-end ML implementation for clasifying White Spot Disease of farmed shrimp (_Lipoteneaus Vannamei_) in Mexico.   
* An initial model for the identification of risk factors of White Spot Disease is carefully selected based on the work of Hasan, Haque, Hinchliffe & Guilder (2020).

## Project Description 📑
The main goal is to build ML Models that determine White Spot Disease by conducting Explorative Data Analysis, Feature Engineering and Selection along with a comparison of classification performance of the optimal ML Models.

- White Spot Syndrome Virus is responsible for high mortality rates and large economic losses across shrimp farming industry in all the world. 
- In Mexico, the prevalence of the virus is concerning both shrimp farmers and local authorities as the frequency of outbreaks have recently increased.
- Risk Factors
  - Farm characteristics
  - Environmental variables 
  - Disease history 
  - Management variables

A detailed description of the features is found in the Theoretical_Background directory of this repository.

## Data Source📊
- Repository name: Mendeley 
- Data identification number: http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/nz96v5spbf.2 
- Direct URL to data: https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/nz96v5spbf/2

## Findings 📈
- The best optimal ML Model assessed by classification performance (accuracy, precision, recall and f1-score) and execution time is the Naive Bayes Classifier. 
  - After performing hyper-parameter tunning of SVC, XGBoost and Random Forest models, the classification performance equaled the Bayes Classifier, however, execution time remained higher. 
  - Logistic Regression had the lowest classification performance. 
- The top ten selected features given by a Random Forest model are applied for building the ML models.
